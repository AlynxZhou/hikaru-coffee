# Dependences

## Node.js

Hikaru is written in CoffeeScript, so you should install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Git (optional)

If you want to install themes with [git](https://git-scm.com/), you need to install it.

# Install

If you have installed dependences, you can install Hikaru with NPM:

```
# npm i -g hikaru-coffee
```

Hikaru is a command line program and it provides a binary called `hikaru`, so you need to install it globally as root.
